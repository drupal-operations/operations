# Developing Drupal Operations


## Testing

Currently the only tests we have are Behat tests.

If you can assist in writing PHPUnit tests or other things, please see https://www.drupal.org/project/operations/issues/3377151

### Behat Tests

To run behat tests, we have a drush plugin:

        lando drush behat

## CI/CD

This project uses Drupal's GitLab CI for testing.

See https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/git/using-gitlab-to-contribute-to-drupal/gitlab-ci

### Running GitLab CI tests locally

See https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/git/using-gitlab-to-contribute-to-drupal/gitlab-ci#s-running-gitlab-ci-tests-locally

With this help, we've added a helper script to this repo:

        ./scripts/gitlab-ci-local

Which does:

        npm install gitlab-ci-local

Which installs the node script to ./node_modules/.bin/gitlab-ci-local, then runs it.

More coming soon...
